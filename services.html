        <h1>Broadway Concierge Group Memberships</h3>

<p>As New York's leading luxury concierge service and lifestyle management company, we offer dedicated concierges to take care of everything for our clients while they make the most of their time and life. Whether for business or pleasure, from luxury travel planning and access to the best restaurants to exclusive events and a complete VIP lifestyle we offer monthly memberships personalized for each and every client. In addition, we offer flexible hourly packages that give you the flexibility of using the service whenever you want without any commitments.</p>


<h2>Corporate Monthly Memberships</h2>
<p>Our monthly corporate membership offers a dedicated concierge to provide the best that life has to offer. This membership includes access to your own in-house concierge Monday – Friday from 9am – 6pm, exclusive and unique offers ranging from travel, nightlife, wellness, restaurants, entertainment & sporting tickets as well as practical assistance. Our team of professionals will handle all of your staff’s personal needs during the day allowing them to stay productive at work. As Americans work harder and longer hours, they have less and less time to take care of “personal maintenance;” therefore, having someone handle your errands for you when you are working is quite attractive. Our corporate monthly memberships are a benefit to offer your employees and we offer a competitive employer rate giving your employees unlimited access to our concierge professionals at no additional monthly cost to them.  Contact us at info@broadwayconcierge.com for more information on pricing and how to become a Broadway Member.</p>

<h2>Individual Monthly Memberships</h2>
<p>Our monthly individual membership provides you with a personal lifestyle specialist in the city of your choice and unlimited access for all your concierge needs. Your Professional Concierge will get to know your likes and dislikes and will proactively suggest events that you might like to attend and benefits that might be of interest. As concierge professionals, not only do we make the impossible, possible; we personalize each experience to match the needs of our clients and deliver the same quality results each and every time you use our services. This is a useful membership for those who are at work and do not have the ability to accomplish the needed tasks, those that have done a cost-benefit analysis and decided it is a worthy, timesaving service and people who need tasks handled in their preferred city. Allow us to let you fall in love with your life by using Broadway Concierge for all your personal and professional needs. Contact us at info@broadwayconcierge.com for more information on pricing and how to become a Broadway Concierge Member.</p>

<h2>Hourly Services</h2>
<p>Not sure if a monthly membership is what you are looking for? No worries, we give you the flexibility to choose what better fits your needs based on your budget. While the membership rates offer you exclusive membership perks and benefits, Broadway Concierge offers hourly rates that allow you to customize each and every service as you see fit. The hourly plan gives you the flexibility of using the service whenever you want without any commitments.  Contact us at info@broadwayconcierge.com for more information on hourly pricing and services.</p>
